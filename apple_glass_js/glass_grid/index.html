                <p>Driven by the thought, "What if I lead a technical club?", I made the transformative leap to become the President of the Alan Turing Club (ATC). This role was a catalyst for personal and collective growth, where I led a dedicated team of 30 students to significantly expand the culture of competitive coding. I successfully orchestrated domestic coding contests in partnership with Coding Ninjas, initiated Inter-college face-offs, and strategically brought in influential figures like Yash Garg & Ansh Mehra to educate students on emerging tech fields like AI integration. Under my leadership, ATC became a recognized institution, transforming me from a self-proclaimed introvert into a name frequently heard by aspiring students and Unacademy tutors alike.</p>
